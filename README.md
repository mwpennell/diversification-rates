This repository contains the code and data to run analyses for the paper "Why extinction estimates from molecular phylogenies are so low" by [Matthew Pennell](https://www.zoology.ubc.ca/person/matthew-pennell) and [Stilianos Louca](http://www.loucalab.com/). The code relies on the R package *castor* ([paper](https://academic.oup.com/bioinformatics/article/34/6/1053/4582279) and [website](http://www.loucalab.com/lib/php/index.php?section=Software&page=../../SECTION_Software/MODULE_Software/CLASS_Software/UNIT_castor/page.php)), which is also available on [CRAN](https://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/castor/index.html).
